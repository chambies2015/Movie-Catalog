# Movie Tracker

## Overview

Movie Tracker is an evolution of my original Movie Catalog project. It provides a clean FastAPI backend and UI for managing and tracking movies you plan to watch or have already watched. The refactored code organizes the backend into a Python package called `movie_tracker`, making it easy to integrate into larger applications.

## Features

- **Scalable package structure:** All backend code is organized under `movie_tracker`, with clear separation of models, schemas, CRUD functions, and the FastAPI entry point.
- **CRUD API:** Endpoints to list, create, read, update, and delete movies.
- **SQLite persistence:** A lightweight database stores movie data locally.
- **Search and sort:** Search by title or director and sort results by rating or year.
- **CORS enabled:** The API is configured to accept requests from your local UI or other clients.
- **Modern UI:** A standalone HTML file (see `ui/movie_tracker_ui.html`) lets you interact with the API. It supports light and dark modes and a sleek, responsive design.

## Running the API

1. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install fastapi uvicorn sqlalchemy pydantic
   ```

2. Start the server:
   Run the start.bat to start the server and automatically open the UI file.

   The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` for interactive Swagger documentation.

## Using the UI

The `ui/movie_tracker_ui.html` file provides a modern frontâ€‘end for your tracker:

- **Add movies:** Enter a title, director, year, rating, and watched flag.
- **List & search:** View all movies, search by keyword, and sort by rating or year.
- **Edit & delete:** Modify existing entries or remove them entirely.
- **Night mode:** Toggle between light and dark themes.

To avoid CORS issues when opening the UI directly, either serve it via a local web server (e.g., `python -m http.server`) or keep CORS enabled in FastAPI.
